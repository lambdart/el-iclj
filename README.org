* Introduction

  From Masteringemacs:

  One of the hallmarks of Emacs is its ability to interface with
  external processes and add to the user experience with the full
  coterie of Emacs functionality like syntax highlighting, macros,
  command history, and so on. This functionality has been in Emacs
  since time immemorial, yet few people make their own command
  interpreters – also known as comint – in Emacs, fearing that it is
  either really difficult or not possible.

  It’s not surprising people feel this way when you consider how
  woefully underdocumented this functionality is; the few, scattered
  references to comint “mode” reveal little, and as a hacker you are
  forced to use the source, Luke.

  So, this is a simple Clojure *REPL* support for *Emacs* that can be
  used to help edit/investigate any Clojure source code from the
  associated buffer (or not).

* Goal

  Be a lightweight alternative to ~emacs-clojure/(cider and
  inf-clojure)~ following the *Emacs/Elisp* philosophy.

* Version

  - Alpha: 0.0.1

* Dependencies

  - comint
  - clojure-mode (optional)

* Tested on

  | Emacs   | 27.1 | 28.0 |
  | FreeBSD | 12.1 | 12.2 |
  | OpenBSD |  6.8 |      |

* Installation
** Manually

   Clone =Inf-clojure= repository to an arbitrary location:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/lambdart/inf-clojure ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/inf-clojure

   #+END_SRC

   Add =Inf-clojure= directory to =load-path= in your
   Emacs initialization file (~init.el~) and load it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load-path
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/replace/me/to/inf-clojure/full/path")

   ;; load inf-clojure feature
   (require 'inf-clojure nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   - Note: For a more dynamic approach:
     - =M-x load-file RET=
     - =M-x load-library RET inf-clojure RET=

** Compile

   * Note: Optional (recommended).

   To compile the files to the =Elisp= byte-compiled representation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   [at-inf-clojure-root-directory]$ gmake

   #+END_SRC

* Usage
* Customize

  * Note: To see all the options from =Emacs= directly, and to customize it,
    just type: =M-x customize-group RET inf-clojure RET=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  Deisgn patterns are spoonfeed material for brainless programmers incapable of independet
  thought, who will be resolved producing code as mediocre as the design patterns they used
  to create it.
  #+END_SRC
